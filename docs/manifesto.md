A Letter to the Community: Explaining Our Fork of Aeternity – September 3rd/4th, 2025
We are an international, decentralized team from Europe and North America. We are currently in the process of incorporating charitable, non-profit entities with the mission to further develop the existing open-source codebase originally created by the Aeternity team. This codebase serves as critical core infrastructure and should remain freely available for public benefit.
To ensure long-term independence, we recognize the need for sustainable and predictable funding. Therefore, these non-profit organizations will seek charitable status in their respective jurisdictions. To secure stable financial support, we are adopting a proven model used by many successful open-source projects: separating activities into two distinct entities.
The first is a non-profit organization focused on advancing the core open-source technology. The second is a commercial, for-profit arm that develops and licenses, for example, turnkey-ready solutions for enterprise and industrial clients, specialized products and custom on-demand products a client asks for based on the core technology. Profits generated by the commercial entity will fund both the ongoing development of the core infrastructure — via donations to the non-profit — and the continued innovation of commercial products.
This dual-model approach represents a key difference from the previous Aeternity team’s strategy. We have carefully analyzed the factors that led to Aeternity’s decline. In our assessment, the absence of a sustainable revenue model based on real-world product sales was a primary cause of its economic failure. Without organic income, long-term development and community growth became unviable.
Our goal is to avoid repeating this outcome. We aim to build a resilient, self-sustaining ecosystem where innovation thrives over decades, not just market cycles. We are not driven by short-term crypto market volatility, but by a long-term vision to develop disruptive technologies that improve life on this planet for all people.
Our team has deep roots in academia and research and development (R&D), with members who have worked in labs with world-renowned scientists, including labs of Nobel Prize laureates. We have had access to cutting-edge research and advanced computing systems used in top-secret development environments. This background equips us with the expertise needed to advance this technology into a new era of innovation. Moreover, we have a successful entrepreneur in our team who has a degree in finance from an Ivy League University and working experience in the crypto industry (2017-2019) and is familiar with the regulatory hurdles authorities like the SEC can cause to crypto projects.
We are currently establishing a robust and compliant legal framework in the most suitable jurisdictions for our mission. This includes clearing legal hurdles, securing support from academic and industrial partners, and raising sufficient funding to ensure years of continuous R&D. These foundational steps must be completed before we can fully resume active development of the codebase.
We chose to fork the project because we believe a fresh start is essential for long-term success. We were not involved in Aeternity’s past development, and we respect the technological achievements of the original team. However, we also recognize that the Aeternity brand has been significantly damaged, making it extremely difficult to attract funding, partners, or institutional support under the existing brand name.
Since our focus is on delivering real-world use cases and sustainable business applications, we concluded that forking the project was the only viable path forward. We believe this new beginning offers the best opportunity to rebuild trust, grow the community, and to unlock the technology’s full potential.
We kindly ask for your understanding and support as we lay the groundwork for a sustainable and impactful future. Please allow us the necessary time to establish a strong foundation — legally, technologically, and organizationally — before we fully resume development.
We have ambitious plans for the future, including world-leading inventions and innovations built on this powerful technology. Our focus is on long-term value creation, not short-term speculation. We view our mission as developing a cutting edge R&D ecosystem leading to technology that has massively positive impact on humanity.
We believe that by combining open-source integrity with a sustainable business model, we can create a thriving ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders including developers, users, enterprises, and society as a whole.
Further announcements will follow as we reach key milestones. Thank you for your attention and continued interest.
